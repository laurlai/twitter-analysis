# Twitter Analysis
Playground for trying out Twitter API and the art of the possible.

So far, I have performed a basic data pull from a single user Twitter account and assessed the sentiment of the tweets. Eventually, I would like to analyze the followers of these accounts as a mini customer segment analysis.

### Methodology
Using the Twitter API and Tweepy Python library, I pulled 

**Skills and Libraries:**
* *Twitter API, Tweepy* to grab data
* *RegEx* for pattern recognition
* *pandas* for organizing, processing, and storing the data in an analysis-friendly way
* *scikit-learn* for feature extraction and text vectorizing

### Potential Use Cases/Analyses
* What are the most commonly-used words in tweets that are most re-tweeted?
* Who has the most @ mentions on this account?
* How has the polarity or subjectivity of the tweets changed over time?
